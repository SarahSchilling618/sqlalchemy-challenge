# sqlalchemy-challenge
Module 10 Assignment

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file that uses sqlaclehmy to analyze a dataset that collects percipitation and overall weather statictics in Honolulu over the past twelve months. After finding the highest and lowest temperatures at the most active station, an app.py was created that futher analyzes the data in a simple to read API that contains the most relevant information. The csv files that were used to analyze this data are also included in the respository files. I used information that I learned while in class, as well as the XPert Learning Assistant provided on Bootcamp Spot to help complete this assignment.
